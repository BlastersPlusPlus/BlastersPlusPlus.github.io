                                    your PC, or, on New 3DS consoles, accessing it via the Internet through System Settings
                                    → Data Management.</li>
                                <li>Navigate through your 3DS's SD Card by going to 'luma/titles.' In short, you should be
                                    inside the titles folder, with your full folder path being '[SD Card]/luma/titles.'</li>
                                <li>Locate your YO-KAI WATCH BLASTERS titleID. This can vary depending on the version and
                                    region you have. If the titleID folder you need does not exist, create one with the
                                    titleID you need. Here are the titleIDs for the international releases of the game:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>RCC PAL: 00040000001CEC00</li>

                                    folder, go inside this folder.</li>
                                <li>Open the mod file that you downloaded earlier using an appropiate program such as WinRAR. Inside it there will be a 'romfs' folder. Drag
                                    this folder into the folder you're in.</li>
                                <li>Power off your console. With the SD card inserted, hold SELECT while powering it on. This should open the Luma menu.
                                    Make sure 'Enable game patching' is set (marked as (x)). If it's not, enable it and save the changes.</li>

                            <p>Yes, you will lose your Blasters ++ Yo-kai. Without the mod active, the game can’t identify the modded Yo-kai, so it deletes them. The game only deletes the Blasters ++ Yo-kai when you boot the game and save, so if game patching is disabled but the game wasn’t saved the Yo-kai should be fine.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, if the Yo-kai are deleted from the game by turning off the mod and saving, the game will still register the medal as taking up a medal slot, meaning a medal slot will be lost forever.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <p>The same applies to other content introduced by the mod, such as new items. We recommend keeping two separate save files if you plan to alternate between using and not using Blasters ++.</p>

                            <p>The 3DS online servers shut down in April of 2024, but there are custom-built servers for several games.
                                For Blasters, there is Level256 network, which disables game patching, meaning that <strong>you cannot regularly use Blasters ++ and Level256 at the same</strong>.<br>
                                At the time of writing, Pretendo Network does <b>not</b> support Blasters yet.</p>

                            <p>You can play online on Citra by changing some configurations to enable the use of different lobbies</p>
                            <p>In order to do this, you need to open the <span class="code">qt-config.ini</span> Citra configuration file.
                                On Windows, this file is found at <span class="code">C:\Users\&lt;your username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Citra\config</span>.
                                Open it using Notepad and search for WebService (you can do this with the shortcut Ctrl+F if your device is in English).
                                Replace the <span class="code">web_api_url</span> lines with the following:</p>
                            <p><span class="code">web_api_url\default=false<br>
                                    web_api_url=http:/88.198.47.46:5000</span></p>
                            <p>After saving your changes (and ensuring the save was succesful!), you should be able to join multiplayer rooms. If Citra is currently open, you will need to close and reopen it to let the changes take place.</p>
                            <p>To play with others, you will need to join a room. In the multiplayer menu, you can either browse public rooms or directly join one given its address and port. Once in the room, you can open the game and go to <strong>local multiplayer</strong> to start playing.</p>

                        <section>
                            <p>Note that, when playing with others without the mod, they won't be able to see Blasters ++ Yo-kai. Depending on who hosts the room, other behaviors will also change.<br>
                            When playing Blasters ++ online, make sure to avoid playing with users without the mod (or with different versions of it) so as to not ruin their experience. Likewise, follow the guidelines of whatever online service you are using.</p>

                            <p>Your console has the game update (Moon Rabbit Crew) installed which has several resources within it that make the game work.
                                In the mod romfs folder there are additional and modified files that contain the new content added by Blasters ++.
                                The usual method to play the mod relies on the console loading these external assets when loading the game, and applying them over the existing files within the update installed on the console, but the <span class="code">boot.firm</span> required to use the Level256 plugin disables this.
                                To use this method again, you need to replace the Level256 <span class="code">boot.firm</span> with the one from Luma, which you can find inside <span class="code">Luma3DS.zip</span> from <a href="https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest">the Github repository</a>.</p>
